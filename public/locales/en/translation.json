          "Sheehan joined Kak Seto School, in the middle of semester 1 in grade 1. At that time, Sheehan was a new student. Three months into her time at Kak Seto School, Sheehan\"s progress was already visible. Sheehan\"s speech, fine motor skills, independence, focus span, socializing with friends, and creativity and ideas are \"significant\" from before. Sheehan is currently in Grade 2. Thankful to find a school that is very focused and detailed for the development of children, not only academically but also"
